Questions
1 When are let and const used? What do they mean â€” and how are they different from var?

let is used to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or
expression on which it is used.

const is used to declare variables. The value of a constant can't be changed through
reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator), and it can't be redeclared.
therefore const declaration creates block-scoped constants.

var is used to declare a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.


Therefore if you do not want a variable declared inside a scope to be accessed outside of the
scope, then declare the variable using the let or const keywords.
Variables declared with the var keyword inside a scope are accessible outside of the block too.





2 How can we use a variable after we've defined it?





3. How do we declare a string?

A string can be declared as by using the let, var or const keyword
followed by an alphanumeric word that starts with an underscore or an
alphabet this is the variable's name.

Then an equal to sign is placed at the right hand side of the variable name.

An alphanumeric word(s) is then put in between two double quotation marks then
placed to the right hand side of the equal to sign.

Finally a semi-colon is placed to the right hand side of the last double quotation.
